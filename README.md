# FreezeCam

FreezeCam is a small Python utility that lets you freeze your webcam on its last frame using OBS Virtual Camera.

It is meant to be a simple, open alternative to proprietary camera software that offers freeze-frame functionality.

Note that for it to work you need to have obs installed.
